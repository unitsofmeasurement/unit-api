/**
 * Measurement is the assignment of values to objects or events.
 * <p>
 * Any measurement can be judged by the following meta-measurement criteria
 * values:
 * <ul>
 * <li>level of measurement (which includes magnitude)</li>
 * <li>dimensions (units)</li>
 * <li>uncertainty.</li>
 * </ul>
 * They enable comparisons to be done between different measurements and reduce
 * confusion. Even in cases of clear qualitative similarity or difference,
 * increased precision through quantitative measurement is often preferred in
 * order to aid in replication. For example, different colors may be based
 * either on wavelengths of light or (qualitative) terms such as "green" and
 * "blue" which are often interpreted differently by different people.<br>
 * Some measurements like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clothing_sizes">clothing sizes</a> use a non-numeric magnitude e.g. "<type>XL</type>" rather than an actual number used by other standards or countries in this area.<br>
 * The API therefore offers a {@link ValueSupplier} like it's used by the  {@link Quantity} subtype, but does not mandate it for {@link Measurement}. Leaving implementations a freedom of choice for an appropriate getter of such values. For mentioned examples like "green" or "X-Large" this could simply be a <code>toString()</code> method, too or methods provided by a used type such as {@linkplain Enum}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Measurement instances should be immutable.
 * </p>
 *
 * @param <Q>
 *            The type of the measurement.
 * @param <V>
 *            The measured value.
