/**
 * Degree of hotness or coldness of a body or an environment. The metric system unit for this quantity is "K" (Kelvin).
 *
 * The kelvin, symbol K, is the SI unit of thermodynamic temperature. It is defined by
 * taking the fixed numerical value of the Boltzmann constant k to be 1.380 649 × 10−²³
 * when expressed in the unit J K⁻¹, which is equal to kg m² s⁻² K⁻¹, where the
 * kilogram, metre and second are defined in terms of h, c and ∆νCs.
 *
 * This definition implies the exact relation k = 1.380 649 × 10⁻²³ kg m² s⁻² K⁻¹. Inverting this
 * relation gives an exact expression for the kelvin in terms of the defining constants k, h and
 * ∆νCs:
 *
 * 1 K = (1.380 649 / k) × 10⁻²³ kg m² s⁻²
