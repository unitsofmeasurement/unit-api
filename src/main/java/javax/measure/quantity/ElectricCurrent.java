/**
 * Amount of electric charge flowing past a specified circuit point per unit time. The metric system unit for this quantity is "A" (Ampere).
 *
 * The ampere, symbol A, is the SI unit of electric current. It is defined by taking the
 * fixed numerical value of the elementary charge e to be 1.602 176 634 × 10⁻¹⁹ when
 * expressed in the unit C, which is equal to A s, where the second is defined in terms
 * of ∆νCs.
 *
 * This definition implies the exact relation e = 1.602 176 634 × 10⁻¹⁹ A s. Inverting this
 * relation gives an exact expression for the unit ampere in terms of the defining constants e
 * and ∆νCs:
 *
 * 1 A = (e / 1.602 176 634 × 10⁻¹⁹) s⁻¹
