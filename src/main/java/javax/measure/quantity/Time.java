/**
 * Period of existence or persistence. The metric system unit for this quantity is "s" (second).
 *
 * The second, symbol s, is the SI unit of time. It is defined by taking the fixed
 * numerical value of the caesium frequency ∆νCs, the unperturbed ground-state
 * hyperfine transition frequency of the caesium 133 atom, to be 9 192 631 770 when
 * expressed in the unit Hz, which is equal to s⁻¹.
 *
 * This definition implies the exact relation ∆νCs = 9 192 631 770 Hz. Inverting this relation
 * gives an expression for the unit second in terms of the defining constant ∆νCs:
 *
 * 1 Hz = ∆νCs / 9 192 631 770  or  1 s = 9 192 631 770 / ∆νCs
