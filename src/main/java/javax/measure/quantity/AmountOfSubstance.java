/**
 * Number of elementary entities (molecules, for example) of a substance. The metric system unit for this quantity is "mol" (mole).
 *
 * The mole, symbol mol, is the SI unit of amount of substance. One mole contains
 * exactly 6.022 140 76 × 10²³ elementary entities. This number is the fixed numerical
 * value of the Avogadro constant, NA, when expressed in the unit mol⁻¹ and is called
 * the Avogadro number.
 *
 * The amount of substance, symbol n, of a system is a measure of the number of
 * specified elementary entities. An elementary entity may be an atom, a molecule, an
 * ion, an electron, any other particle or specified group of particles.
 * This definition implies the exact relation Nₐ = 6.022 140 76 × 10²³ mol⁻¹.
 *
 * Inverting this relation gives an exact expression for the mole in terms of the defining constant NA:
 *
 * 1 mol = 6.02214076 × 10²³ / Nₐ
