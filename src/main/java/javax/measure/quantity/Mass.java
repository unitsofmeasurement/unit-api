/**
 * Measure of the quantity of matter that a body or an object contains. The mass of the body is not dependent on gravity and therefore is different
 * from but proportional to its weight. The metric system unit for this quantity is "kg" (kilogram).
 *
 * The kilogram, symbol kg, is the SI unit of mass. It is defined by taking the fixed
 * numerical value of the Planck constant h to be 6.626 070 15 × 10⁻³⁴ when expressed
 * in the unit J s, which is equal to kg m² s−1, where the metre and the second are
 * defined in terms of c and ∆νCs.
 *
 * This definition implies the exact relation h = 6.626 070 15 × 10−34 kg m² s⁻¹. Inverting this
 * relation gives an exact expression for the kilogram in terms of the three defining constants
 * h, ∆νCs and c:
 *
 * 1 kg = (h / 6.626 070 15 × 10⁻³⁴) m⁻² s
