/**
 * Represents a quantitative property of a phenomenon, body, or substance, that
 * can be quantified by measurement. {@link javax.measure.quantity.Mass Mass},

 * of quantitative properties.

 * </dl> 
 * This interface defines some arithmetic operations between {@code Quantity}
 * instances. All implementations shall produce <em>equivalent</em> results for
 * the same operation applied on equivalent quantities. Two quantities are
 * equivalent if, after conversion to the same unit of measurement, they have
 * the same numerical value (ignoring rounding errors). For example 2000 metres
 * is equivalent to 2 km, but 2°C is not equivalent to 2 K; it is equivalent to
 * 275.15 K instead. Above requirement applied to addition means that 2°C + 2 K
 * shall be equivalent to 275.15 K + 2 K.
 *
 * <p>All operations shall preserve the
 * <a href="https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Basic_Laws_of_Algebra">basic laws
 * of algebra</a>, in particular <b>commutativity</b> of addition and
 * multiplication (<var>A</var> + <var>B</var> = <var>B</var> + <var>A</var>)
 * and <b>associativity</b> of addition and multiplication (<var>A</var> +
 * <var>B</var>) + <var>C</var> = <var>A</var> + (<var>B</var> + <var>C</var>).
 * In order to preserve those algebra laws, this specification requires all
 * arithmetic operations to execute <em>as is</em> all operands were converted
 * to {@linkplain Unit#getSystemUnit() system unit} before the operation is
 * carried out, and the result converted back to any compatible unit at
 * implementation choice. For example 4 cm + 1 inch shall produce any result
 * <em>equivalent</em> to 0.04 m + 0.0254 m.</p>
 *
 * <p>Implementations are allowed to avoid conversion to system unit if the
 * result is guaranteed to be equivalent. This is often the case when the
 * conversion between quantity unit and system unit is only a
 * {@linkplain UnitConverter#isLinear() scale factor}. However this is not
 * the case for conversions applying an offset or more complex formula.
 * For example 2°C - 1 K = 274.15°C, not 1°C. This counter-intuitive result
 * is essential for preserving algebra laws like associativity, and is also
 * the expected result from a thermodynamic point of view.</p>
